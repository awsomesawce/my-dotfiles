	    # In bash this will only expand to first value
echo "${array[*]}" # use this to access all values at once in both zsh and bash
echo "${array[@]}" # expands values as _separate_ words.
# in zsh, set KSH_ARRAYS to 1 to have them evaluate the same as bash arrays, indexed starting with 0 instead of 1
