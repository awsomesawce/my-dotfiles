# Powershell config

Please see [my pwsh git repo](https://github.com/awsomesawce/scripts-pwsh) for
the most up to date Powershell config.

## Why a separate repo

My current Powershell config requires more than a few scripts.  I have started
to divide the functionalities into separate modules and use `import-module`.

This allows functions to be separated by module and allows me to see which module
each command is sourced from.
