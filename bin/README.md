# Readme for bin directory

Tools and utility scripts to help automate.

zshrcupdate.sh will update zshrc into dotfiles directory and label it `debian.zshrc`

This directory contains most of my hand-written shell scripts.

## Dirs

- `/complete`: completion scripts go here.
- `/installers`: installer scripts go here.
- `/random_scripts`: miscellanious scripts go here.
- `/update`: update scripts go here.
Make sure scripts don't convert to CRLF when trying to execute them in unix environments
