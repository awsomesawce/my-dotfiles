# Readme for bin directory

Tools and utility scripts to help automate.

zshrcupdate.sh will update zshrc into dotfiles directory and label it `distro.zshrc` where `distro` is the 
linux distribution I'm currently in.

This directory contains most of my hand-written shell scripts.

## Dirs

- `/complete`: completion scripts go here.
- `/installers`: installer scripts go here.
- `/random_scripts`: miscellanious scripts go here.
- `/update`: update scripts go here.
    _Update scripts are for system updates only_.
- `/shell_learning`: learning scripts for learning shell scripting.

Also included is the `cht.sh` script from [cht.sh](https://cht.sh).
