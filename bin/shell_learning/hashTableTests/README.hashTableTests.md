# Hash Tables in Unix Shells

Hash Tables aka Dictionaries aka Associative Arrays are available to use in Unix shells.
Sadly, they cannot be nested as they can in other programming languages, including Powershell.

If you want a nested key=value system/format then you should use a format like json or yaml.

## TODO
- [ ] Write a script to iterate over a json file using bash/zsh plus jq
