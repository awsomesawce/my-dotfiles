## Vim TODOs

- [ ] Edit down some `vim` autocommands.
- [ ] Make `nvim` act like `nvim` does on **Windows** with the autocompletion.
- [ ] set a variable/shortcut inside `nvim` to open `nvim`'s config file quickly (from inside `nvim`).
  You can invoke the shell from inside nvim and access the `nvimconfig` alias from there, but that's a hacky way to do it.
- [ ] Make `nvim` quicker to start up.
- [ ] set |completefunc|
