# Dash init file
#
# Dash is the POSIX-flavored shell
# Dash stands for Debian Almquist Shell
# It is meant to be fast, small, and portable
# Nothing that is non-POSIX will be supported or usable
# This means any "bashisms" that might be present in shell-scripts will not be supported or won't work correctly.
########
# The following statement should be included before `dash' is invoked or in `$HOME/.profile'
#ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV
